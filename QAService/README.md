# Ewwww, thats disgusting!

**[Customer]**  It is, isn't it. Imagine, a professional software company actually wrote that! 
And, they charged us money for it. If I had been here during at the time when this was
written, I would have canceled the contract on the spot!

**[You]** It never ceases to amaze me, the number of coders out there that care about neither
the quality nor the aesthetics of their code. But don't worry, we gotcha back! We will have
this refactored in no time!

**[Customer]** Alright. Let me know when you're done!

Good thing **"we"** didn't write that code in the first place, or we would have been in trouble! <br>
Now, let's clean up this mess! <br><br>

**[Step 1]**
Do a code analysis and document your findings.<br>
The first step in a refactoring job is to get a high-level overview of what the code is doing, and<br>
how it's doing it.<br>
<br>
What type of objects are present?<br>
Which layering strategy has been chosen if any?<br>
How well is the code separated?<br>
Does the code follow the principals of SOLID?<br><br>
Make a list of at least 5 shortcomings<br>
Make a note on how you would go about fixing the issue<br><br>
